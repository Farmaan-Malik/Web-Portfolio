<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name if Farmaan Malik, I'm 22 years old and i'm an undergraduate pursuing computer science at SSM college. I'm in the 3rd year of my degree
  and trying to learn everyday. Web-designing has caught my interest a lot lately and i'm trying to make websites that will hopefully catch people's eyes.
  I want to make it in the world so obviously i'm trying to be more than just an "okay" web designer. I want to learn lots of things and take more and 
  more projects on. More projects means more work which eventually means learning new things. Thats my goal right now, to learn.  
</p>

<p>There are things i want to do and making it as a web0-designer might just allow me to do all the other things i want to do.
  There's always someone better than you and i know there are a lot of people that are way better than me and i cant wait to meet them. I want 
  to work and interact with people and hopefully learn from them. Everyday i strive to be a better web-designer than yesterday and slowly but 
  surely i'm going to get better at it. 
</p>
