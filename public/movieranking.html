<hr/>
<h3>Kimi No nawa</h3>
<p>A beautiful storyline and great animations.</p>
<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>You will definitely fall in love with the plot, the characters and the CGI. Overall a great freakin movie.</p>
<h3>Spiderman- Across the spider-verse</h3>
<p>Breathtaking animations and character design. It makes that connection between the audience and the characters that so many other movies fail to make. The ending might leave you wanting more.</p>
